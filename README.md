Project Status

🚧 This project is currently ongoing.

Available Notebooks
**1. RT_DETR.ipynb**

This notebook demonstrates the core people detection pipeline. It includes:

The working implementation of the RT-DETR model

Experiments conducted to improve the accuracy of counting the number of people under different scenarios

The notebook reflects the iterative experimentation process used to evaluate and compare detection performance.

**2. HVAC_polygons.ipynb**

This notebook focuses on spatial mapping between detected regions and HVAC units. It includes:

Creation of polygons using YOLO-based detections

Mapping of these polygons to the actual HVAC units

Logical association between detected occupancy zones and corresponding HVAC systems

This mapping is a key step toward enabling occupancy-aware HVAC control.
